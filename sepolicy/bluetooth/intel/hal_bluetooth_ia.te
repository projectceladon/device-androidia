# For treble mode, the HAL is loaded by a excutable hal service, and
# framework need request the hal service if it want to operate the
# device by HAL.
# For bluetooth, the default hal service is created by Google named
# android.hardware.bluetooth@1.0-service
# Google also setup sepolicy types and rules for the hal services, and
# android.hardware.bluetooth@1.0-service is one of hal services.
# The sepolicy type and rules for the hal services are created by Google
# and locate at system/sepolicy/vendor/hal_xxx.te
# For bluetooth it is hal_bluetooth_default.te, and the content of this
# file is
#
#
#    type hal_bluetooth_default, domain;
#    hal_server_domain(hal_bluetooth_default, hal_bluetooth)

#    type hal_bluetooth_default_exec, exec_type, file_type;

#    # Logging for backward compatibility
#    allow hal_bluetooth_default bluetooth_data_file:dir ra_dir_perms;
#    allow hal_bluetooth_default bluetooth_data_file:file create_file_perms;
#
# Google allow vendor to write his own hal service, but do not suggest
# directly modify the default hal service code. Google also give the reference
# code(device/linaro/hikey/bluetooth) about how to write vendor's own hal
# service.
# For gordon peak, bluetooth hal service need to be changed because some
# message handling difference with Google's default one. Then the bluetooth
# hal service for gordon peak is created based on default one.
# The sepolicy types and rules for gordon peak bluetooth service needs to be
# created too based on the default one.
# The following setting are copied from hal_bluetooth_default.te except use
# extension "gordon_peak" to replace "default".
